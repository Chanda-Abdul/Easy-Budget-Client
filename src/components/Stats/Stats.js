        <h3>Plan for your future</h3>A budget is a plan on how you will spend
        your money. You keep track of money you earn and things you want to buy.
        Then you plan ahead of time what you can buy based on how much money you
        will earn.

        <h3>Stop wasting money</h3>Now figure the difference between your
        expenses and your income. Hopefully, you have more income than expenses.
        If not, then you need to figure out ways you can cut back on your
        expenses. You need to budget your expenses to be less than or equal to
        what you make. It can also help you to buy those special things you
        really want rather than wasting your money on spur of the moment
        spending.{" "}

        <h3>Achieve your goals</h3>A budget can be helpful in saving for
